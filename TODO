! = Important

Gabriel:
        - Styling for pages:    ! feed.php (positioning and layout)
                                ! profile.php (positioning of boxes)
                                ! gallery.php (styling)
                                ! upload.php (layout)
                                ! verify_account.php (styling & get button working)
        - Posts: on hover --> adds a transparent black overlay and displays amount of likes in the middle of the image
        - general style improvements
        - stlye the email displayed in profile.php and user_search.php

        - ADD THIS INTO THE HEADER BAR ONLY FOR FEED.PHP WHEN A USER IS LOGGED IN:
                <form action="./user_search.php" method="post">
                        <input type="text" name="search_param" placeholder="username search">
                        <input type="submit" name="search" value="GO!">
                </form>


Jadon:
        - Find a way to return to previous pages' *position* for likes, comments, deletions -> AJAX
        - Do those cool notification bar things (for profile updates and post notifications and uploading)
        - ! Find a way to only allow a user to select only one filter at a time
        - ! do clear filter button in upload page

notes:
the webcam isnt stable on launch of other apps it can stop working, dunno if theres a possible fix --> maybe just your mac??

- php at the bottom of the gallery and feed pages removes the footer from the html if there are no posts --> why is this needed? The footer should *always* be there
