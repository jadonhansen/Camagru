Gabriel:
        - Styling for pages:    ! feed.php (positioning and layout)
                                ! profile.php (positioning of boxes)
                                ! gallery.php (styling)
                                ! upload.php (layout)
                                ! verify_account.php (styling & get button working)
        - Posts: on hover --> adds a transparent black overlay and displays amount of likes in the middle of the image
        - general style improvements
        - stlye the email displayed in profile.php and user_search.php

Jadon:
        - Reloading of elements not pages (likes, comments, delete)-> AJAX
        - Do those cool notification bar things (for profile updates and post notifications and uploading)
        - try cool css effect on ICON
        - ! COMMENTS SECTION

        pagination of 5 images per page
        no php injections
        intialise db if its not already initiliased

NOTES:
the webcam isn't stable on launch of other apps it can stop working, dunno if theres a possible fix --> maybe just your mac??

- php at the bottom of the gallery and feed pages removes the footer from the html if there are no posts --> why is this needed? The footer should *always* be there
