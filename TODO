Gabriel:
- Styling for pages:   ! feed.php
                       ! profile.php
                       ! gallery.php
                       ! upload.php (need a box for webcam, filters sidebar and bottom section for post button & browse file button...anything else?)
                       ! verify_account.php
- do those cool notification bar things (for profile updates and post notifications and uploading - I can research this)
- footer text (I can do that, just needs your styling)

Jadon:
- save and display properly
- Find a way to return to previous pages' *position* for likes, comments, deletions -> AJAX
- index page doesnt always work  ----------->>> WORKING ON THAT (only happens when the session is already set)
