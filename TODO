! = Important

Gabriel:
        - Styling for pages:    ! feed.php (positioning and layout)
                                ! profile.php (positioning of boxes)
                                ! gallery.php (styling)
                                ! upload.php (layout)
                                ! verify_account.php (styling & get button working)
        - Posts: on hover --> adds a transparent black overlay and displays amount of likes in the middle of the image
        
        -general style improvements

Jadon:
        - Find a way to return to previous pages' *position* for likes, comments, deletions -> AJAX
        - ! Do those cool notification bar things (for profile updates and post notifications and uploading)
        - ! Find a way to only allow a user to select only one filter at a time (now the upload file doesn't work if i've cleared before)
        - Search bar for users (maybe??)
        - php at the bottom of the gallery and feed pages removes the footer from the html if there are no posts
        - fix clear filter button in upload page

NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO EXPORT THE NEW VERSION OF ICON DB IN CONFIG FOLDER
&& I added two extra buttons on the profile page ;)

notes:
the webcam isnt stable on launch of other apps it can stop working, dunno if theres a possible fix
