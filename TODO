! = Important

Gabriel:
- Styling for pages:   ! feed.php
                       ! profile.php
                       ! gallery.php (Test infinite scroll thing in gallery with js)
                       ! upload.php (need a box for webcam, filters sidebar and bottom section for post button & browse file button...anything else?)
                       ! verify_account.php
- do those cool notification bar things (for profile updates and post notifications and uploading - I can research this)
- footer text (I can do that, just needs your styling)

Jadon:
- Test infinite scroll thing in gallery with js
- Add auto refresh to feed (might not be needed)
- Add superimpose function to upload page
- Add filter images to upload page as selectable
- Find a way to return to previous pages' *position* for likes, comments, deletions -> AJAX


- Images in Feed are loading as machine code ------------->>> NOT FOR ME PENIS
- index page doesnt always work  ----------->>> WORKING ON THAT (only happens when the session is already set)
