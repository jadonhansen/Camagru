! = Important

Gabriel:
- Styling for pages:   ! feed.php (positioning and layout)
                       ! profile.phpv (positioning of boxes)
                       ! gallery.php (layout --> same as the feed, one under the other)
                       ! upload.php (layout)
                       ! verify_account.php (styling & get button working)
- Posts: on hover --> adds a transparent black overlay and displays amount of likes in the middle of the image
- STYLE the text "No posts to view here yet!" which displays on the feed & gallery page (Just centre the text in the middle of the screen)
- footer text (below)

            TEXT: " @jhansen jadongavhansen@gmail.com

Jadon:
- Find a way to return to previous pages' *position* for likes, comments, deletions -> AJAX
- ! Do those cool notification bar things (for profile updates and post notifications and uploading)
- ! Find a way to only allow a user to select only one filter at a time
- Search bar for users (maybe??)
- config/database.php


NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO EXPORT THE NEW VERSION OF ICON DB IN CONFIG FOLDER
&& I added two extra buttons on the profile page ;)
